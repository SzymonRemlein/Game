# Game
 This is my first project in Unreal Engine 5 and is still in the development phase.
 
For now I have done it to a greater or lesser extent:
- an inventory system (open and close "I" button),
- items system,
-  statistic system (open and close "B" button, in debug key I used "T" to add experience),
-  quest system,
-  system for moving items from bodies or crates (open and close "E" button but this is easy to see),
-  traiding system,
-  combat system
- key change system in options.
